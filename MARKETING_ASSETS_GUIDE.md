Title: I've been tracking crypto whales for 2 years. Here's what I learned.

Body:
After losing money on surprise market moves, I started seriously tracking whale wallets. Here are the patterns I've noticed:

1. **Dormant Wallet Activation**: When a wallet that's been inactive for 30+ days suddenly moves funds, there's often a price movement within 24-48 hours

2. **Exchange Clustering**: If you see 5+ whales moving to the same exchange within a short time frame, it's usually a coordinated sell-off signal

3. **Sunday Night Movements**: Whales tend to move assets Sunday night (EST) when liquidity is lower

4. **Split Transfers**: Large transfers split across multiple transactions are often more significant than single large moves

I now use WhalePlus to automate this tracking. It's helped me avoid several major losses and catch a few good entries.

**Tools I use:**
- WhalePlus for real-time alerts
- Guardian for risk analysis
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns

Happy to answer questions about whale tracking!
