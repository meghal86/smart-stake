## üîß Implementation Guide

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run the migration
supabase db push

# The migration creates all necessary tables and RLS policies
```

### 2. Edge Function Deployment
```bash
# Deploy the alert processor function
supabase functions deploy custom-alert-processor

# Set required environment variables
supabase secrets set SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
```

### 3. Frontend Integration
```tsx
// Add to your whale tracking page
import { AlertQuickActions } from '@/components/alerts/AlertQuickActions';

// In your component
<AlertQuickActions />
```

### 4. Webhook Integration
Users can configure webhook URLs to receive alerts in external systems:

```json
{
  "rule": {
    "id": "rule-uuid",
    "name": "Large ETH Movements"
  },
  "alert": {
    "from_addr": "0x...",
    "to_addr": "0x...",
    "amount_usd": 2500000,
    "token": "ETH",
    "chain": "ethereum",
    "tx_hash": "0x..."
  },
  "matchedConditions": {
    "amount": 2500000,
    "token": "ETH"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## üìä Alert Condition Types

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Rules Not Triggering
1. Check rule is active (`is_active = true`)
2. Verify conditions match alert data
3. Check frequency limits aren't exceeded
4. Review logic operator (AND vs OR)

#### Delivery Failures
1. Verify webhook URLs are accessible
2. Check notification permissions
3. Review delivery status in history
4. Test individual channels

#### Performance Issues
1. Monitor Edge function logs
2. Check database query performance
3. Review rule complexity
4. Optimize condition logic

### Debug Commands
```sql
-- Check active rules for user
SELECT * FROM alert_rules WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid' AND is_active = true;

-- View recent rule history
SELECT * FROM alert_rule_history WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid' ORDER BY triggered_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check template usage
SELECT name, popularity_score FROM alert_templates ORDER BY popularity_score DESC;
```
