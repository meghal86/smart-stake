# 🚀 Phase D "Energy & Emotion" - Complete Implementation

## ✅ All Priority Fixes Implemented (P0, P1, P2)

### P0 — Clarity & Consistency (FIXED)

1. **✅ Time notation unified**
   - Consistent relative times by default ("51m ago")
   - Timezone shown in MicroTicker banner
   - Absolute times available on hover

2. **✅ Latency badge consistency**
   - Only shown where meaningful (Raw + expanded All)
   - Hidden in Top unless >1s (shows "cached" or "delayed")

3. **✅ Amount formatting perfected**
   - $477.0M displays as $477M (no trailing decimals)
   - Below $1M shows $883K format
   - Tabular-nums across all right columns

4. **✅ Risk labeling unified**
   - Consistent grammar: "Severity: Low/Medium/High"
   - Clear distinction from bias (Accumulation/Distribution)
   - Confidence shown as 0–100%

5. **✅ Explicit state change cues**
   - "↓ Details" / "↑ Hide" with animated chevron
   - Visual rotation animation on expand/collapse
   - Clear interaction feedback

### P1 — Predictive & Behavioral (IMPLEMENTED)

6. **✅ Outcome prediction system**
   - "Based on similar last 30 cases: +1.2–2.4% drift within 24h"
   - Pro feature gating with backtest modal link
   - Placed under AI confidence in Top & All tabs

7. **✅ Group dynamics tags**
   - "Rising density", "Coordinated wallets (4)", "Recurring pattern"
   - Smart detection for cluster patterns
   - Color-coded badges for different dynamics

8. **✅ "New items (X)" with auto-pause**
   - Auto-pause updates during user interaction
   - Resume button with new items count
   - Prevents cognitive churn during exploration

### P2 — A11y/Motion/Perf Polish (COMPLETE)

9. **✅ Comprehensive ARIA & role labels**
   - Each card: `role="region"` with descriptive aria-label
   - ExplainModal: proper `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`
   - All interactive elements have accessible labels

10. **✅ Motion safety compliance**
    - All animations check `prefers-reduced-motion`
    - Graceful degradation with shadows & color only
    - Zero motion when accessibility preference set

11. **✅ Performance virtualization**
    - Raw Data ready with full virtualization
    - "All" tab uses windowing for >100 cards
    - Prevents layout jank with large datasets

## 🎯 Screen-by-Screen Enhancements

### Top Flows (Guidance Layer)
- ✅ Micro-history badge: "Last similar → +2.3% 24h"
- ✅ Enhanced sparklines for visual ranking context
- ✅ Outcome prediction integration

### All 50 (Story Layer)
- ✅ Sticky filter bar (pinned on scroll)
- ✅ Coordinated wallets badges for grouped signals
- ✅ Auto-pause with new items notification
- ✅ Virtualization for performance

### Raw Data (Truth Layer)
- ✅ Sort toggles (Value USD, Direction, Time)
- ✅ Colored left borders (inflow vs outflow)
- ✅ Heatmap gradient behind Value USD
- ✅ Enhanced export functionality

### Explain Modal (Learning Layer)
- ✅ Predictive pointers with similar cases
- ✅ "Show last 5 similar → micro chart overlay"
- ✅ Share functionality for virality
- ✅ Clear notification promise

## 📊 Production Telemetry System

Comprehensive tracking implemented via `PhaseDTelemetry`:

```typescript
{
  "feed_heartbeat_pulsed": { "interval": 5, "latency_ms": 800, "status": "live" },
  "narrative_rendered": { "bias": "buy", "inflows": 479000000, "outflows": 17000000, "window": "1h" },
  "group_expanded": { "asset": "BTC", "direction": "inflow", "count": 45, "totalUsd": 477000000 },
  "quick_action_clicked": { "action": "create_alert", "asset": "BTC", "context": "card_action_row" },
  "explain_opened": { "asset": "BTC", "amountUsd": 6500000, "confidence": 85 },
  "raw_export": { "format": "csv", "rows": 50 }
}
```

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Motion Safety System
